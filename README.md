# ðŸ§¾ Employee Payroll System (Java OOP)

The **Employee Payroll System** is a simple Java-based mini project that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**.  
It allows managing employees as **Full-Time** or **Part-Time**, calculating their salaries, and performing basic operations like adding, removing, and displaying employees.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Add employees (Full-Time / Part-Time)
- Remove employees by ID
- Display employee details with salary calculation
- Clean implementation of **Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Java (JDK 8 or higher)**
- **Collections Framework** (`ArrayList`, `List`)

---

## ðŸ“– OOP Concepts Highlighted
- **Abstraction** â†’ `Employee` is declared as an abstract class  
- **Encapsulation** â†’ Employee details (`name`, `id`, etc.) are private with getters  
- **Inheritance** â†’ `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` extend `Employee`  
- **Polymorphism** â†’ `calculateSalary()` and `toString()` methods are overridden
